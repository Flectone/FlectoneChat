You can try it with `/chatcolor`

## Patterns
Chat patterns is a system for replacing any custom words/patterns.  
Each `chat.patterns` (config.yml) field is a new pattern that specifies the expression to be replaced and the expression it will be replaced with.  
The expressions are separated by combining the characters "` , `"

A few standard patterns:
```yaml
chat:
  patterns:
    - ":) , ‚ò∫"
    - ":D , ‚òª"
    - ":( , ‚òπ"
    - ":ok: , üñí"
    - ":+1: , üñí"
    - ":-1: , üñì"
    - ":cool: , üòé"
    - "B) , üòé"
    - ":clown: , ü§°"
    - "<3 , ‚ù§"
    - "xd , üòÜ"
    - "%) , üòµ"
    - "=D , üòÉ"
    - ">:( , üò°"
    - ":idk: , ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø"
    - ":angry: , (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞)‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª"
    - ":happy: , Ôºº(ÔºæOÔºæ)Ôºè"
```

## Items in chat

## Formatting in chat
formatting in chat is only available to players with certain permissions.  
The player with op has these permissions by default

If a player has the `flectonechat.formatting` permission, he can use the built-in formatting colors of minecraft (`&c` for red or `&l` for bold for example).

If a player has the `flectonechat.placeholders` permission, he can use placeholders from PlaceholderAPI directly in chat.

## Hiding words (spoilers)
Your players can hide words with `||word||` syntax. The word would be shown on hover

Mentions are clickable and plays custom sound for mentioned player!

FlectoneChat has a built-in chat bubble system.  
They are compatible with gsit and similar plugins
