# Formatting

formatting is only available to players with certain permissions.\
The player with op has these permissions by default

If a player has the `flectonechat.formatting` permission, he can use the built-in formatting colors of minecraft (`&c`
for red or `&l` for bold for example).

If a player has the `flectonechat.placeholders` permission, he can use placeholders from PlaceholderAPI directly in
chat.

!!! warning
    Access to placeholderAPI is dangerous and can lead to information leakage

Formatting can also be used in anvils, signs and books!\
You can disable it in the [config.yml](../configuration.md#chatanvil-formatting)
